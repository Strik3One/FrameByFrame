# Project

How to start developing:

* Install NodeJS. Go to: https://nodejs.org/en/
* I recommend using Visual Studio Code as IDE: https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Download this repo
* Build the node project. To do that go to the local copy of the repository in your machine with the console and type:
  ```
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
* To start (without IDE) type:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
* To package a build type:
  ```
  npm run dist
  ```
